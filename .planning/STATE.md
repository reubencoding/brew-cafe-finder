# BREW Bug Fixes - Project State

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-09
**Current Phase:** None (roadmap not yet approved)
**Mode:** YOLO | Parallelization: Enabled

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Users can reliably discover cafés, view details with reviews, book tables, and manage their reservations — without errors or broken features.

**Current Focus:** Fix 4 critical bug categories:
- JavaScript conflicts causing page crashes
- Bookings page stuck in loading loop
- Reviews not displaying on café details
- UI stray elements and general stability

**Constraints:** No new features, no redesign, preserve localStorage architecture, maintain Firebase 10.7.1 compatibility.

## Current Position

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Phase** | Phase 4 (General Stability & UI Cleanup) |
| **Plan** | 01 (Complete) |
| **Status** | All phases complete — bug fix cycle finished |
| **Progress** | 100% (4/4 phases complete) |

**Progress Bar:**

```
[==================================================] 100%
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Console errors (any page) | 0 | Unknown (unfixed) |
| Bookings page load time | <5s | Stuck in loading |
| Reviews display success | 100% of cafés | Broken |
| Auth persistence | Across sessions | Broken |
| Pages error-free | 6/6 | 0/6 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Fix JS conflicts first | Syntax errors block all functionality | — Pending |
| No major refactoring | Maintain existing architecture | — Locked |
| Keep localStorage for café data | Existing working design | — Locked |
| Targeted bug fixes only | Scope constrained to v1 requirements | — Locked |
| Used withTimeout pattern for Firestore queries | Prevent indefinite hangs, maintain 15s timeout consistency | ✓ Completed |

---

### Blockers

**Pre-roadmap:**
- Awaiting roadmap approval from user

**Post-roadmap:**
- Phase 2, 3, 4 depend on Phase 1 completion (JS stability)

---

### Unknowns & Risks

- Firestore query issues may involve complex debugging of security rules or data structure mismatches
- `renderFields()` error on non-auth pages may require careful scoping of auth-specific code
- Booking timeout could be network, query, or syntax-related

---

### Session Continuity

**For next session:**
- Load `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/STATE.md` to resume
- Check `REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed requirement definitions
- Start with `/gsd:plan-phase 1` after roadmap approval

**What's been done:**
- Requirements catalogued (18 v1 requirements across 4 categories)
- Phase structure derived (4 phases, JS stability first)
- Success criteria defined for each phase (2-4 observable outcomes per phase)
- Draft roadmap, state, and traceability prepared

**What remains:**
- User approval of ROADMAP.md
- Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table
- Plan each phase via `/gsd:plan-phase`

---

## Next Actions

1. **User:** Review and approve `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
2. **Orchestrator:** Update `REQUIREMENTS.md` with phase mappings
3. **Claude:** Begin Phase 1 planning with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
